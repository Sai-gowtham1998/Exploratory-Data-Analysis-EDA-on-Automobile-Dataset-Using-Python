# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Automobile Dataset Using Python

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automobile dataset using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, univariate and multivariate analysis, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset's features and relationships.

## Key Features:

1. **Imported File**: Loaded the automobile dataset for analysis.
2. **Checked for Null Values**: Identified missing values in the dataset.
3. **Handled Null Values**: Processed and filled missing values to prepare the data for analysis.
4. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed individual features to understand their distributions and characteristics.
5. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Vehicle by Make Frequency Diagram**: Visualized the distribution of vehicle makes.
   - **Pricing Histogram**: Plotted the distribution of vehicle prices.
   - **Bar Plot for Fuel Type**: Displayed the count of vehicles by fuel type.
   - **Drive Wheels Count Plot**: Showed the count of vehicles by drive wheels type.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Examined the correlation between different columns to understand their relationships.
   - **Scatter Plots**: Created scatter plots for various features to explore potential relationships and patterns.
